When I move to Poland in 2014 it was late sprint. Weather was warm. Whole trip take about 2 days. Short stop in Cracow, after one night in Lod≈º. I have an oportunity to look close to different polish cities.

plan:

 * intro (why, what was before)
 * actual story of process of getting visa and relocations
 * first impression
 * looking back
 * differences between ukr and pol people

I don't actualy remember when I decide seriosly to leave country in which I was born. Looking back I think I always want to, aspecialy with some one like my father. So after living and working for a few years in capital Kyiv, I feeling that some shit is comming move to west part of country - Lviv.

It was awesome expirience after Kiev with terrible traffic and ugly and angry people. It was quet small town with old city and beautifull cafes. Here in Lviv working for SoftServe I meet great people Ivan and Andrey. Both like I from Kyiv.
