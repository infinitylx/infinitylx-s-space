When I move to Poland in 2014 it was late sprint. Weather was warm. Whole trip take about 2 days. Short stop in Cracow, after one night in Lod≈º. I have an oportunity to look close to different polish citys. 

plan:

 * intro (why, what was before)
 * actual story of process of getting visa and relocations
 * first impression
 * looking back
 * differences between ukr and pol people
